# Simon Sommer

Welcome ✌️,

```rust
todo!("Finish profile README.md");
```

**I want to build software the you can love because it –**

- is performant
- acknowledges that errors will happen
  - display them nicely
  - help users to understand them
- is well documentated
- has readable code

All of these have the same importance to me. (not sorted in a particular order)
